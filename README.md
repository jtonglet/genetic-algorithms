# Genetic Algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem ðŸ§¬ðŸ§³ðŸš—

This repository contains the implementation of a genetic algorithm to solve instances of the traveling salesman problem.

The algorithm was created for the course [Genetic Algorithms and Evolutionary Computing](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H02D1AE.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idm9804064) offered at KULeuven in Fall 2022. 

The aim of the project was to implement on our own a genetic algorithm capable of solving 6 instances of increasing size and difficulty of the travellingsalesman problem. Some of those instances are assymetric. 

The implemented algorithm contains several components that promote both exploration and exploitation, including :

- an island model 
- a fitness sharing mechanism in the elimination phase
- a local search operator
- cross-over and mutation operators
- a greedy heuristic to initialize part of the population

The final score was 19 on 20.

# Genetic Algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem ðŸ§¬ðŸ§³ðŸš—

This repository contains the implementation of a genetic algorithm to solve instances of the traveling salesman problem.

The algorithm was created for the course [Genetic Algorithms and Evolutionary Computing](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H02D1AE.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idm9804064) offered at KULeuven in Fall 2022.
